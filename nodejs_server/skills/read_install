local install
npm install lodash
the package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.
As this happens, npm also adds the lodash entry in the dependencies property of the package.json file present in the current folder.

a global install
npm install -g lodash
The npm root -g command will tell you where that exact location is on your machine.
On macOS or Linux this location could be /usr/local/lib/node_modules. On Windows it could be C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules

If you use nvm to manage Node.js versions, however, that location would differ.
For example, if your username is 'joe' and you use nvm, then packages location will show as /Users/joe/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/lib/node_modules.
